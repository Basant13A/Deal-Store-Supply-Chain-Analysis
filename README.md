# 📦 Deal Store Supply Chain Analysis
This repository contains the code, notebooks, dashboards, and presentation for our graduation project from the **Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative (DEPI)** internship. Our team, **Group F**, analyzed a real-world e-commerce supply chain dataset sourced from **Kaggle**. For the purpose of our analysis and storytelling, we referred to the business as **"Deal Store."** The project aimed to uncover key operational challenges and provide data-driven solutions through dashboards and strategic recommendations.

## 📌 Notes

This project was completed remotely as part of the **Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative (DEPI)** under the Data Analysis track. The dataset was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/malaiarasugraj/e-commerce-dataset) and used for educational purposes to simulate real business decision-making.

The name *"Deal Store"* was assigned by the team for clarity and consistency throughout the project presentation and dashboards.
